Sure, here's a simple README template for an authentication API using Go:

# Authentication API with Go

This is a simple authentication API built using Go. It provides endpoints for user registration, login, and accessing protected resources.

## Features

- User registration: Users can create an account by providing their username and password.
- User login: Registered users can log in to the system using their credentials.
- Authentication: The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
- Protected routes: Certain routes are protected and require authentication to access.

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine. You can download and install it from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- MongoDB or any other database system to store user data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/authentication-api-go.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd authentication-api-go
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```plaintext
    PORT=8080
    MONGODB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/authentication
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_here
    ```

    Replace `your_jwt_secret_here` with your JWT secret key.

5. Run the application:

    ```bash
    go run main.go
    ```

## Usage

1. Register a new user:

    ```
    POST /api/register
    {
        "username": "example",
        "password": "password"
    }
    ```

2. Login with registered credentials:

    ```
    POST /api/login
    {
        "username": "example",
        "password": "password"
    }
    ```

    Successful login will return a JWT token.

3. Use the token to access protected routes by including it in the Authorization header:

    ```
    GET /api/protected
    Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
    ```
